### üìò Course Overview

This undergraduate course introduced the **fundamental concepts of Control Systems**, emphasizing analysis, modeling, and design of feedback systems used in **electrical, mechanical, and electronic engineering** applications.  
Students explored how to represent and analyze dynamic systems using **transfer functions, state-space models, block diagrams**, and **signal flow graphs**, and learned to evaluate system performance using both **time-domain** and **frequency-domain** techniques.

### üéØ Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students were able to:
- Understand the **principles of open-loop and closed-loop control systems**.  
- Model physical systems using **differential equations** and **Laplace transforms**.  
- Derive and interpret **transfer functions** for electrical, mechanical, and electromechanical systems.  
- Analyze **system stability** using **Routh‚ÄìHurwitz**, **Bode**, **Nyquist**, and **Root Locus** methods.  
- Design **PID controllers** and perform system compensation for desired performance.  
- Use **MATLAB/Simulink** for simulation and validation of control system behavior.

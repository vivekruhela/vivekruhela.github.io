miRSim generates realistic miRNA and piRNA sequencing reads so researchers can evaluate the accuracy of their analysis workflows against ground truth data. The simulator supports seed and xseed sequence alterations, making it possible to stress-test pipelines and ensure dysregulated miRNAs are identified reliably.

BRAINscape is an interactive Shiny-based visualization platform that integrates multi-ethnic brain eQTL and GWAS data to uncover ancestry-specific regulatory mechanisms in Alzheimer’s disease. It enables users to seamlessly explore cis- and trans-eQTLs, perform colocalization analysis, and visualize gene-variant associations across populations — advancing insights into the genetic architecture of AD and supporting precision medicine research.

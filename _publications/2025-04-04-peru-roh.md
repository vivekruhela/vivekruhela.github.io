collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: 'Runs of Homozygosity (ROH) reveal hidden ancestral signals linked to Alzheimer’s Disease in Peruvian and Mexican populations — uncovering shared genomic regions enriched with African ancestry. This study highlights the power of population-specific ROH and ancestry mapping in understanding the genetic roots of Alzheimer’s disease.'

In this conferences abstract, we aimed to investigate the association between regions of homozygosity (ROH) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We explored local genetic ancestry and rare variant enrichment in the most prevalent consensus ROH regions to understand their potential role in AD pathogenesis.

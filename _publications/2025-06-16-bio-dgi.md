Can AI map the molecular code of cancer?

In our study, we built BIO-DGI, a bio-inspired graph learning model that deciphers how genes interact to drive Multiple Myeloma (MM) progression from its precursor stage MGUS. By integrating SNVs, CNVs, and SVs from genomic data with network-based AI insights, we identified a clinically validated 295-gene panel strongly linked to MM-related pathways.

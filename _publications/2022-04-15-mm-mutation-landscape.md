Can mutation patterns predict cancer outcomes?
In this study, we explored how the mutational burden and signatures evolve as MGUS progresses to Multiple Myeloma (MM) â€” and how they relate to patient survival. Analyzing genomic data from over 1,000 MM and 61 MGUS cases, we found that hypermutators had poorer survival, with distinct increases in C>A and C>T substitutions and APOBEC activity.

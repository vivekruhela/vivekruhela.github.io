title: "Characterizing the mutational landscape of MM and its precursor MGUS"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
excerpt: "Can mutation patterns predict cancer outcomes? In this study, we explored how the mutational burden and signatures evolve as MGUS progresses to Multiple Myeloma (MM) — and how they relate to patient survival. Analyzing genomic data from over 1,000 MM and 61 MGUS cases, we found that hypermutators had poorer survival, with distinct increases in C>A and C>T substitutions and APOBEC activity. Want to know how mutation dynamics can forecast cancer progression and prognosis? Check out our paper to find out!"

Mutational Signatures and Tumor mutational burden (TMB) have emerged as prognostic biomarkers in cancer genomics. However, the association of TMB with overall survival (OS) is still unknown in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) patients. Further, the change in the mutational spectrum involving both synonymous and non-synonymous mutations as MGUS progresses to MM is unexplored. This study addresses both these aspects via extensive evaluation of the mutations in MGUS and NDMM. WES data of 1018 NDMM patients and 61 MGUS patients collected from three different global regions were analyzed in this study. Single base substitutions, mutational signatures and TMB were inferred from the variants identified in MGUS and MM patients. The cutoff value for TMB was estimated to divide patients into low TMB and high TMB (hypermutators) groups. This study finds a change in the mutational spectrum with a statistically significant increase from MGUS to MM. There was a statistically significant increase in the frequency of all the three categories of variants, non-synonymous (NS), synonymous (SYN), and others (OTH), from MGUS to MM (P<0.05). However, there was a statistically significant rise in the TMB values for TMB_NS and TMB_SYN only. We also observed that 3’ and 5’UTR mutations were more frequent in MM and might be responsible for driving MGUS to MM via regulatory binding sites. NDMM patients were also examined separately along with their survival outcomes. The frequency of hypermutators was low in MM with poor OS and PFS outcome. We observed a statistically significant rise in the frequency of C>A and C>T substitutions and a statistically significant decline in T>G substitutions in the MM patients with poor outcomes. Additionally, there was a statistically significant increase in the TMB of the patients with poor outcome compared to patients with a superior outcome. A statistically significant association between the APOBEC activity and poor overall survival in MM was discovered. These findings have potential clinical relevance and can assist in designing risk-adapted therapies to inhibit the progression of MGUS to MM and prolong the overall survival in high-risk MM patients.

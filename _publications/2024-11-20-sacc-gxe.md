title: "Gene by Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Interaction Effects on Growth and Cognition in Mother- Child Dyads in a South African Birth Cohort"
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: "Mother–child genetic interactions reveal new insights into Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) — uncovering key risk genes linked to growth and neurodevelopment in South African cohorts. Genes in the methyl donor metabolism pathway (e.g., MTHFR, FADS1/2) suggest potential for nutrient-based interventions like choline to mitigate prenatal alcohol effects."

Comprehensive single-marker and gene-based analyses of mother and child genotype data revealed statistically significant markers demonstrating interaction effects with prenatal alcohol exposure on FASD outcomes.

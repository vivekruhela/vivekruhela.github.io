title: "AI-based models for the identification of critical genetic biomarkers to distinguish MM from MGUS using the WES data"
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: "Machine learning decodes the genetic switch from MGUS to Multiple Myeloma (MM) â€” identifying key driver genes like HLA-DQB1, IRF1, and FGFR3 that distinguish the two stages with over 95% accuracy. This AI-powered approach reveals pivotal biomarkers shaping myeloma progression, offering clues for early detection and targeted intervention."

MGUS and MM share many common features such as genomic biomarkers, structural variants etc. with the difference of having less impact of mutations in MGUS. Thus, it is challenging to distinguish MM from MGUS. Here, we utilized ML classifi ers to distinguish MM from MGUS. Our classifi ers are able to identify the signifi cant genes that are helpful in MM vs. MGUS classifi cation that can lead to a better understanding of progression from MGUS to MM.

title: "AI-based models for the identification of critical genetic biomarkers to distinguish MM from MGUS using the WES data"
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: "Machine learning decodes the genetic switch from MGUS to Multiple Myeloma (MM) â€” identifying key driver genes like HLA-DQB1, IRF1, and FGFR3 that distinguish the two stages with over 95% accuracy. This AI-powered approach reveals pivotal biomarkers shaping myeloma progression, offering clues for early detection and targeted intervention."

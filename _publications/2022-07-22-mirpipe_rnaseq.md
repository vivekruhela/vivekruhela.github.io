Meet miRPipe â€” our end-to-end framework that accurately detects and quantifies known and novel miRNAs and piRNAs from small-RNA sequencing data. By combining seed-based clustering and novel sequence analysis, miRPipe outperforms existing tools, revealing more cancer-linked small RNAs across CLL, lung, and breast cancer datasets.

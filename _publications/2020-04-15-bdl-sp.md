Using our Bio-inspired Deep Learning model (BDL-SP), we explored how Multiple Myeloma (MM) emerges from its precancerous stage MGUS. By integrating gene-gene networks and whole-exome data from over 1,200 patients, BDL-SP uncovered key oncogenes, tumor suppressors, and dysregulated pathways driving this transition â€” outperforming traditional machine-learning models in biological insight.

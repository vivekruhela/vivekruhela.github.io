Hi, I’m Dr. Vivek Ruhela, a researcher passionate about unraveling the genetic and molecular architecture of complex diseases through the fusion of genomics, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence.

I currently work as a Postdoctoral Research Scientist in the (GiusTo Lab)[https://www.neurology.columbia.edu/research/research-labs/giusto-lab], Columbia University , where I investigate how genomic variation, gene- and pathway-level associations, and large-scale meta-analyses, powered by advanced sttistical and machine learning approaches to enhence our understanding of complex traits and neurodegenerative diseases. My work integrates whole-genome sequencing, multi-omics, and machine learning to identify hidden patterns of genetic influence across diverse populations.

Before joining Columbia, I was part of the (SBILab)[https://sbilab.iiitd.edu.in/] (Signal Processing and Biomedical Imaging Lab) at the Indraprastha Institute of Informatino Technology, New Delhi, where I explored the intersection of genomics and artificial intelligence — developing bioinformatics workflows for RNA transcriptomic analysis, **miRPipe**, **miRSim**, in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), and designing bio-inspired, AI-powered frameworks such as **BDL-SP** and **BIO-DGI** to decode the mutational landscape and identify key molecular drivers in Multiple Myeloma (MM). That cross-disciplinary foundation continues to guide how I connect biological intelligence and artificial intelligence to decode disease complexity and improve prediction and prevention strategies.

# Research Interests

Genomics & Transcriptomics: Understanding how genetic and expression landscapes vary across individuals and populations.

AI & Machine Learning: Developing interpretable AI models for biomarker discovery and precision medicine.

Bioinformatics Pipelines: Building scalable, GPU-accelerated tools for large-scale multi-omics data analysis.

Population & Evolutionary Genetics: Exploring how population-specific variants and homozygosity patterns influence disease risk.

Beyond analysis and coding, I enjoy creating visual narratives that translate complex biological insights into accessible knowledge — blending science, storytelling, and design.
